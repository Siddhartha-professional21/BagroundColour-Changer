# BackgroundColour-Changer

BackgroundColour-Changer is a lightweight React + Vite + Tailwind web app that lets users seamlessly switch the page’s background color with a single click. Built to explore React’s useState hook, this project demonstrates how to manage and update component state in real time. I deployed it via GitHub Pages to solidify my understanding of Vite-powered builds, Tailwind utility classes, and simple state-driven UI updates.
